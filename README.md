# Indian-Election-Data-Visualization-Dashboard-1962--2019-

Interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing Indian Lok Sabha election outcomes from 1962–2019, designed to make multi-decade comparisons clear and consistent by focusing on the top five parties by cumulative votes.

Project Goals
- Analyze long-term shifts in party dominance across six decades.
- Compare vote share distributions by gender across major parties.
- Measure how candidate loyalty (loyal vs. turncoat) relates to win rates over time.
- Explore how turnout and vote share connect to victory margins across constituency types (General/SC/ST).

Data Preparation
- Performed cleaning and standardization steps to improve analytical quality:
- Dropped 13 columns due to missing values or limited analytical value.
- Standardized party naming (e.g., 'B.J.P.' → 'BJP').
- Corrected rows with misplaced data to ensure accuracy.
